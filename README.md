# basic-projects-Python

Greetings reader,
	
This repository is made for new learners looking forward to enhance their programming skills by learning/building simple but useful and efficient projects in Python. The repository consists of 10 basic mini projects which uses a vast amount of Python's basic knowledge. I hope you take your time to look around and enjoy this small initiative of mine!

Disclaimer: Every python file in this repository are solely written by me from scratch. Any resemblance to the work of any other individual or organisation is pure coincidence.
